# NetLogo Sound extension **Original Version from NetLogo 6.1**

This package contains the NetLogo sound extension.

## Building

Use the netlogo.jar.url environment variable to tell sbt which NetLogo.jar to compile against (defaults to NetLogo 5.3). For example:

    sbt -Dnetlogo.jar.url=file:///path/to/NetLogo/target/NetLogo.jar

If compilation succeeds, `sound.jar` will be created.

## Using

The Sound Extension lets NetLogo models make two kinds of sounds:
MIDI sounds and playback of pre-recorded sound files.

The Java APIs used are `javax.sound.midi` and `java.applet.AudioClip`.

### How to Use

The sound extension comes preinstalled. To use the extension in your
model, add this at the top of your Code tab:
```
extensions [sound]
```

If your model already uses other extensions, then it already has an
`extensions` line in it, so just add `sound` to the list.

For more information on using NetLogo extensions,
see the [Extensions Guide](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/extensions.html)

For examples that use the sound extension, see the Sound section
under Code Examples in the NetLogo Models Library.

### MIDI support

The MIDI part of the extension simulates a 128-key electronic
keyboard with [47 drums](#drum-names) and [128 melodic instruments](#instrument-names), as provided by
<a href="https://www.midi.org/about-midi/gm/gm1_spec.shtml" target="_blank">General
MIDI Level 1 specification</a>.

It supports 15 polyphonic instrument channels and a single percussion
channel. Using more than 15 different melodic instruments
simultaneously in a model will cause some sounds to be lost or cut
off.

The pitch of a melodic instrument is specified by a key number. The
keys on the keyboard are numbered consecutively from 0 to 127, where
0 is the left-most key. Middle C is key number 60.

The loudness of an instrument is specified by a velocity, which
represents the force with which the keyboard key is depressed.
Velocity ranges from 0 to 127, where 64 is the standard velocity. A
higher velocity results in a louder sound.

## Primitives

[`sound:drums`](#sounddrums)
[`sound:instruments`](#soundinstruments)
[`sound:play-drum`](#soundplay-drum)
[`sound:play-note`](#soundplay-note)
[`sound:play-note-later`](#soundplay-note-later)


### `sound:drums`

```NetLogo
sound:drums
```


Reports a list of the names of the [47 drums](#drum-names)
for use with `sound:play-drum`.



### `sound:instruments`

```NetLogo
sound:instruments
```


Reports a list of the names of the [128 instruments](#instrument-names)
for use with `sound:play-note`, `sound:play-note-later`,
`sound:start-note` and `sound:stop-note`.



### `sound:play-drum`

```NetLogo
sound:play-drum drum velocity
```


Plays a drum.

Example:

```NetLogo
sound:play-drum "ACOUSTIC SNARE" 64
```



### `sound:play-note`

```NetLogo
sound:play-note instrument keynumber velocity duration
```


Plays a note for a specified duration, in seconds. The agent does not
wait for the note to finish before continuing to next command.

```NetLogo
;; play a trumpet at middle C for two seconds
sound:play-note "TRUMPET" 60 64 2
```



### `sound:play-note-later`

```NetLogo
sound:play-note-later delay instrument keynumber velocity duration
```


Waits for the specified delay before playing the note for a specified
duration, in seconds. The agent does not wait for the note to finish
before continuing to next command.

Example:

```NetLogo
;; in one second, play a trumpet at middle C for two seconds
sound:play-note-later 1 "TRUMPET" 60 64 2
```
