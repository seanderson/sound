Here are are few ideas about combining elements in the Sound Extension.  Experiment!  There are many others.

Record interesting textures and use them as the basis for rhythm instruments.

Use voices or sounds to create notes.  You can automatically create sounds at many pitches using MakeScales or simply sing at the pitches.  If you save to a file (X-60.wav), then this will be assumed to be at midipitch number 60, just as if it had been autogenerated.  This is good for getting more naturalistic pitches or customizing your "instrument".

Record a drone or other longer sound.  You can play it in a loop underneath your composition using `sound:loop-play`.
